# prisma-ecommerce

This example will ultimately serve as the backoffice for [prisma-ecommerce](https://github.com/Weakky/prisma-ecommerce), another ongoing project.

You can find the prisma *datamodel* used by this backoffice on the link above.

This example is currently both used to test `ra-data-prisma2` for ease of development, and to showcase the library.

It will eventually be moved to `prisma-ecommerce` repository once it reaches the level of features that `prisma-ecommerce`'s backoffice has.

## Installation

- Just `npm install` or `yarn install`
- Then `yarn start`
